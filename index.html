<h2>Pokemon: red and green</h2>
<p>The first ever pokemon game was pokemon: red and green, created by Satoshi Tajiri. It was released first in Japan, 1996. This game would be the start of a long series. This game fetured Ash, a pokemon hunter, who captured pokemon to use in battles. He especially liked to battle with his arch nemisis Gary Oakes, with his best friend- the pokemon Pikachu, who would go on to feature in his own game later. </p>
